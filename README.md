# Optical Fiber Fusion Splicing using the Ericsson FSU-975

This repository documents an experiment on **optical fiber fusion splicing** using the **Ericsson FSU-975 fusion splicer**. This exercise was conducted to gain hands-on experience with fiber optic preparation, splicing, and splice loss estimation.

## üéØ Aim of the Experiment

To understand and execute a complete fiber optic welding process, including:
- Preparing optical fibers for fusion
- Operating the Ericsson FSU-975 fusion splicer
- Measuring welding quality through visual inspection and attenuation value.

## üß™ Procedure

### 1. Introduction to the Equipment
- The **Ericsson FSU-975** is a single fiber fusion splicer used for precise fiber optic welding.
- It supports multiple splice types: **tape**, **gate**, and **lens** configurations.

### 2. Fiber Preparation
- Stripped ~30 mm of the outer protective coating
- Cleaned exposed fibers using isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs
- Cleaved fibers with a high-precision cleaver ensuring perpendicular ends (~20 mm exposed)

### 3. Fusion Splicing Process
- Positioned fibers in the V-grooves visible on the monitor
- Closed the safety cover and initiated the **Auto Mode splicing**
- Pressed ‚ÄúFuse‚Äù to start automatic alignment and fusion
- Monitored loss (target: < 0.2 dB) and verified splice quality via the built-in viewer

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrated the process of fusion splicing, where two optical fibers are welded together under controlled heat using the Ericsson FSU-975 splicer. The quality of the splice is highly dependent on proper fiber preparation ‚Äî including stripping, cleaning, and precise cleaving ‚Äî followed by accurate alignment and welding.

### Key Results:
- Achieved an **attenuation (splice loss) of less than 0.2 dB**
- This is within the typical **industry standard** range, which accepts:
  - **‚â§ 0.10 dB** for high-performance telecom applications
  - **0.2‚Äì0.50 dB** as acceptable in many field installations

### Additional Observations:
- Visual inspection on the splicer was the first checkpoint for splice quality before measuring loss.
- Understanding the weld types (tape, lens) helped in recognizing their application-specific uses.
- The parameter tuning for different splice types (tape, lens, gate) required careful and control tuning.
- Proper fiber cleaving and cleanliness were critical stage to achieving low-loss connections.
